Dear ${userAccessManager.getFullName},

You received an email (copied below) from the ITS Web Team because you have User Access Manager (UAM) permissions in Tabula. This means that you were nominated by your Head of Department to have the most senior role in Tabula for the department. The person with this role has ultimate responsibility for the staff they assign permissions to and, in turn, for the delegation of permissions throughout the department and any sub-departments.

In the email below we asked you to do two things to satisfy the University's data audit requirements:

Confirm by <@fmt.date date=roleConfirmation /> that you continue to be the nominated User Access Manager and that you are in a position to oversee the administration of permissions in Tabula.

To ensure by <@fmt.date date=permissionConfirmation /> that permission levels for staff in your department are accurate and appropriate.

We provided you with a list of URLs to help you to do that.

We have not received your response to the email below and would be grateful if you could contact us to confirm the requests.

Please be aware that, should we not receive a response, due to the audit implications we will need to remove your User Access Manager permissions and ask the Head of Department to select a new User Access Manager.

Thanks for your assistance in this matter.

Many thanks,

ITS Web Team
