Dear ${userAccessManager.getFullName},

We are contacting you because you are currently assigned to the User Access Manager role for <#list departments as department>${department.fullName}<#sep>, </#list> in Tabula (the University's tool to support administration of teaching and learning in academic departments).

This is what the role entails:

The User Access Manager is the most senior role in Tabula. The person assigned to this role has ultimate responsibility for the staff they assign permissions to and, in turn, for the delegation of permissions throughout the department. These permissions control who can see information about students and who can carry out particular tasks related to, for example, attendance monitoring, marking and feedback.

The person assigned to this role should be in a position to oversee administration of all sub-departments within the department, such as Undergraduate and Postgraduate.

In order to satisfy data audit requirements, please could you confirm that you are still performing this role. If you are not, please choose a named person to act in this role and let us know who this is by <@fmt.date date=deadline />.

For any department that does not confirm a User Access Manager by <@fmt.date date=deadline />, we will unfortunately need to remove all existing permissions previously assigned to your department's staff in Tabula.

To discuss this further, please contact the Web Team via tabula@warwick.ac.uk or telephone 74000.

Many thanks,

ITS Web Team
