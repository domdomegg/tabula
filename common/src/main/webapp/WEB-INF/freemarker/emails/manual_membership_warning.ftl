There are manually added students in <@fmt.p numAssignments "assignment"/> and <@fmt.p numSmallGroupSets "small group set"/> in ${department.name}:

It's important that SITS holds up-to-date information on which students take each module.

Please take the following action:

1. Update the membership of the assignments and small group sets in SITS.
2. Once the membership in SITS is accurate, remove any manually added students from assignments and small group sets in Tabula.
