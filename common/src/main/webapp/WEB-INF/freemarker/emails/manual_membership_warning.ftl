<#-- FIXME Needs better wording, link to how to correct data in SITS? -->
At least one assignment or small group set in ${department.name} has manually added students.
It is important that SITS holds up to date information about the students taking each module.
Once the SITS membership for these assignments and small group sets is correct you should remove any manually added students.
