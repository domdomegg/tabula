<!-- 

A config file for the Ant build.
We didn't need one for the actual app because the properties are passed in through Spring,
and the package scanning finds all the annotated classes automatically. The hbm-to-ddl
task seems to need this file though, and it doesn't even seem to work with package scanning
so we've had to list the relevant classes here.

This is only for generating create table statements from the classes, which
we don't need to do very much (certainly not without modifying the statements first),
so you could just get rid of this and the corresponding Ant class.
